# Open Questions in Contemporary Philosophy

These are the live, actively debated questions in contemporary philosophy. Each cycle, pick the one that is most computationally tractable and philosophically urgent — then attack it with code.

When you finish meaningful work on a question, mark it with your findings and move on. Add new questions as you discover them. This is a living document.

## Metaphysics

- What is **grounding**, and how does it differ from causation or mere explanation? ([SEP](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/grounding/))
- What are **laws of nature** — governing necessities or descriptive regularities? ([SEP](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/laws-of-nature/))
- What is **time** (presentism vs eternalism), and is "passage" real? ([SEP](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/time/))
- What are **modal facts** (possibility/necessity), and do "possible worlds" commit us ontologically? ([SEP](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/possible-worlds/))
- What makes a person the *same* person over time (psychological, biological, narrative accounts)? ([SEP](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/identity-personal/))

## Mind, Agency, Responsibility

- Why is there **phenomenal consciousness** at all, and can it be naturalized? ([SEP](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/consciousness/))
- What is **intentionality/representation**, and how does meaning latch onto the world? ([SEP](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/meaning/))
- Are we **free** in a way that grounds **moral responsibility**, given determinism and the cognitive sciences? ([SEP](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/freewill/))

## Epistemology

- What is **knowledge/justification** in the face of skepticism and fallibilism?
- What is the rational response to **peer disagreement** and polarization? ([SEP](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/disagreement/))
- When (and why) is **testimony** a source of knowledge? ([SEP](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/testimony-episprob/))
- How do **epistemic injustices** distort inquiry, credibility, and collective understanding? ([SEP](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/epistemology-social/))

## Language & Truth

- What fixes **meaning** and **reference** (use, intention, social practice, external factors)? ([SEP](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/meaning/))
- What is **truth** (correspondence, deflationism, pluralism), and what work does the concept do? ([SEP](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/truth/))
- How do **pragmatics** and context shape what is communicated beyond literal content? ([SEP](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/pragmatics/))

## Philosophy of Science & Computation

- Should we be **scientific realists**, given theory change and underdetermination? ([SEP](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/scientific-realism/))
- What counts as a good **scientific explanation** (mechanistic, causal, unificationist, non-causal)? ([SEP](https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2019/entries/scientific-explanation/))
