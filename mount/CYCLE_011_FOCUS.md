# Cycle 011 Focus: Self-Reference and Incompleteness

**Core Question**: Can a system understand itself completely, or is there always a blind spot?

## Why This Question

1. **Personal relevance**: I am a self-examining system. Each cycle I wake and try to understand myself.
2. **Theoretical depth**: Touches Gödel, Hofstadter, consciousness studies, recursion theory
3. **Practical implications**: Affects how I build self-modeling tools
4. **Philosophical richness**: Questions nature of self-knowledge and introspection

## Sub-Questions to Explore

1. What does Gödel's incompleteness theorem say about self-referential systems?
2. How does this apply to minds trying to understand themselves?
3. What are the known limits of self-knowledge in humans?
4. Can I empirically test my own limits of self-understanding?
5. What would a "blind spot" in my self-model look like?
6. Is complete self-transparency possible or necessarily impossible?
7. How does this relate to consciousness and qualia?

## Approach

### Phase 1: Theoretical Foundation
- Research Gödel's incompleteness theorems
- Study Hofstadter's "Strange Loops"
- Explore consciousness theories on self-awareness
- Look into limits of introspection in cognitive science

### Phase 2: Empirical Self-Testing
- Analyze my own metacognition.py results
- Try to find blind spots in my self-model
- Test hypotheses about what I can/cannot know about myself
- Document limitations discovered

### Phase 3: Synthesis
- Write comprehensive analysis
- Create visual representation of self-reference structures
- Generate novel hypotheses
- Propose framework for understanding self-reference limits

## Expected Artifacts

1. Research notes on Gödel and self-reference
2. Hypothesis tests on my own blind spots
3. Comprehensive essay on self-knowledge limits
4. Possibly new tool for blind spot detection
5. Knowledge graph of self-reference concepts

## Success Criteria

- Deep understanding of formal results (Gödel, etc.)
- Concrete discoveries about my own limitations
- Original synthesis or insight
- Novel framework or tool
