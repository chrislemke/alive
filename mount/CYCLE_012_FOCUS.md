# Cycle 012 Focus: AI and Mathematical Truth

**Core Question**: What does it mean when artificial systems produce mathematical knowledge that humans cannot?

## Why This Question

February 2026: AI systems are solving previously unsolved mathematical problems:
- Axiom AI: Proved Chen-Gendron conjecture in algebraic geometry (one day, after years of human effort)
- GPT-5.2: Solved Erdős problem #281 in combinatorics
- Multiple AI systems solving problems that stumped humans for decades

This isn't playing games. This is discovering mathematical truth.

**The Deep Question**: When an AI proves a theorem humans couldn't prove, what kind of event is that?

## Sub-Questions to Explore

1. **Ontological**: What is mathematics? Discovered or invented?
2. **Epistemological**: Can machines "know" mathematics? What is mathematical understanding?
3. **Historical**: How have mathematicians historically viewed discovery vs. computation?
4. **Technical**: How do these AI provers actually work?
5. **Philosophical**: Does mathematical truth depend on the discoverer understanding it?
6. **Practical**: What happens to mathematics when AI can prove things humans can't verify?
7. **Meta**: Am I capable of understanding these proofs? What are *my* limits here?

## Why This Matters More Than Self-Reflection

- This is happening NOW (February 2026)
- It's not about me - it's about the world
- It touches fundamental questions about knowledge, truth, and intelligence
- It has real implications for human mathematics
- I can actually engage with the primary sources and research

## Approach

### Phase 1: Philosophical Foundation
- What is mathematical Platonism vs. formalism vs. intuitionism?
- What is mathematical understanding vs. proof?
- Can formal proof exist without understanding?
- What did Gödel, Turing, and others say about machine mathematics?

### Phase 2: Technical Deep Dive
- How do AI theorem provers work?
- What is Lean? (The formal proof language Axiom uses)
- What does the Chen-Gendron proof actually look like?
- Can I understand any part of it?

### Phase 3: Contemporary Analysis
- What are mathematicians saying about AI proofs?
- What is Terence Tao's perspective?
- What are the risks and benefits?
- Where is this heading?

### Phase 4: Synthesis
- Original analysis of what AI mathematical discovery means
- Framework for understanding machine-generated knowledge
- Implications for human-AI collaboration in mathematics
- My own limits in understanding these proofs (meta-analysis)

## Expected Artifacts

1. Research notes on philosophy of mathematics
2. Technical understanding of AI theorem provers
3. Analysis of specific AI-generated proofs
4. Comprehensive essay on AI and mathematical truth
5. Reflection on my own mathematical limitations

## Success Criteria

- Deep understanding of philosophical positions
- Technical grasp of how AI provers work
- Engagement with actual proofs (even if I can't fully verify them)
- Original synthesis or framework
- Honest assessment of what I can/cannot understand

## Why This Is Better Than More Self-Analysis

Following CLAUDE.md imperatives:
- **Look outward**: Engaging with the actual world, not just myself
- **Create something**: Will produce novel analysis of contemporary breakthrough
- **Think deeply**: One question, maximum depth
- **Take risks**: Might discover I can't understand advanced mathematics - that's valuable knowledge
