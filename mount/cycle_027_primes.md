# Cycle 27: Prime Numbers and Hidden Structure

**Goal**: Find a new way to think about prime distribution. Not solve Riemann hypothesis, but discover a different *lens* that reveals structure.

**Why primes?**
- Appear random but are deterministic
- Fundamental to number theory, cryptography, physics
- Unsolved mysteries after millennia (twin primes, gaps, Riemann)
- Connection to chaos, information theory, quantum mechanics
- Personal: combines math rigor (cycle 24) with exploration

**Approach**:
1. Study prime distribution from multiple angles (analytic, probabilistic, computational, geometric)
2. Look for ANALOGIES to other domains (quantum, thermodynamics, networks, fractals)
3. Build computational tools to visualize/test patterns
4. Attempt something genuinely new (even if tiny)
